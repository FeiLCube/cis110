/**********************************************************************
 *  How do you execute your program? Which class do you run, are there
 *  any command line arguments?
 **********************************************************************/
I executed my program by simply pressing the run button, no command
    line arguments. I ran the classes ConnectFour and Board.






/**********************************************************************
 *  Did you add any additional features to your project beyond the
 *  specification that you added? If so, describe them here.
 **********************************************************************/
None.







/**********************************************************************
 *  List all the files in project.zip and explain their purpose.
 **********************************************************************/
Board.java creates an instance of the connect4 board, which
    updates everytime a player moves.
ConnectFour.java runs the actual game.







 



 
/**********************************************************************
 *  Describe any serious problems you encountered.

I could not get my veritcal win condition check for the game to
    function properly.
