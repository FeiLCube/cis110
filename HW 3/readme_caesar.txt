Hours to complete assignment (optional): 10


**********************************************************************
 *  Have you enter all help, collaboration, and outside resources
 *  in your help log?  If not, do so now.  (And in future, make sure
 *  you make your help log entries as you go, not at the end!)
 *
 *  If you did not get any help in outside of TA office hours,
 *  and did not use any materials outside of the standard
 *  course materials and piazza, write the following statement below:
 *  "I did not receive any help outside of TA office hours.  I
 *  did not collaborate with anyone, and I did not use any
 *  resources beyond the standard course materials."

I did not receive any help outside of TA office hours.  I did not collaborate 
with anyone, and I did not use any resources beyond the standard course materials.




**********************************************************************
 *  Problem A: What are the benefits of using functions?                   
**********************************************************************
I can call them when in another function or in main instead of rewriting the
    whole code again. It makes the both the main code and the function code 
    easier to read.




**********************************************************************
 *  Problem B: What are any flaws you can come up with regarding the 
 *  use of a Caesar Cipher to store sensitive data?                 
**********************************************************************
Caesar Cipher is really easy to decrypt. Anyone who could write the code in this
    assignment could decrypt it or just do trial and error with every letter in
    the alphabet.



**********************************************************************
 *  Encrypt the following message with a key value of G, write the
