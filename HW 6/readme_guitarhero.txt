/**********************************************************************
 *  Explain why it makes sense to have a separate RingBuffer class.
 **********************************************************************/
It makes sense to have a separate RingBuffer class because
    RingBuffer is an object that represents one point in time of
    a guitar string after it is plucked. The GuitarString class
    updates the RingBuffer object to resemble the string waves
    as time updates as well.
